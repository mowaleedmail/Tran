# TranslatedTextarea Component Enhancements

**Brief description:** Enhance the `TranslatedTextarea` component to dynamically adjust font size based on text length and ensure both textareas maintain the same size, with a focus on user experience.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Base dynamic height adjustment using `scrollHeight`
- [x] Basic dynamic font size breakpoints (`text-2xl`, `text-lg`, `text-base`)
- [x] Replace height adjustment with text length comparison
- [x] Implement fixed-size textareas with dynamic font sizing
- [x] Add smooth CSS transitions for height and font-size changes
- [x] Optimize performance by comparing text lengths instead of DOM measurements
- [x] Ensure both textareas maintain the same size regardless of content
- [x] Permanently disable scroll in textareas for cleaner UI
- [x] Improve height calculation to account for line wrapping and newlines
- [x] Add container with max-height and overflow for very large content

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Fine-tune font-size breakpoints for better readability

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Implement maximum and minimum height constraints with graceful overflow handling
- [ ] Support continuous font-size scaling instead of discrete breakpoints
- [ ] Add accessibility enhancements (ARIA attributes, focus management)
- [ ] Add user preferences for default font sizes

## Implementation Plan

1. Use text length as the primary metric for sizing instead of DOM measurements.
2. Apply CSS transitions to create smooth changes in font-size and container dimensions.
3. Dynamically adjust the size of both textareas based on whichever has more content.
4. Use line count estimation for more accurate height calculations.
5. Wrap textareas in a scrollable container to handle extremely large content.
6. Write unit tests for resize behavior and benchmark render performance.
