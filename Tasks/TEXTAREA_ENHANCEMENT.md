# Textarea Enhancement Implementation

This feature adds dynamic height adjustment to textareas based on content and synchronized heights between the source and target textareas.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Create a separate file for textarea height and font size logic
- [x] Implement dynamic height adjustment based on text content
- [x] Reduce text size to 16px when character count exceeds 450
- [x] Synchronize height between source and target textareas
- [x] Set minimum height of 450px for medium and large screens
- [x] Integrate the new logic in container.tsx
- [x] Change default font size from 2xl to xl

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Add animation to height transitions for a smoother user experience
- [ ] Test the feature on various devices and screen sizes
- [ ] Consider adding maximum height with scrolling for very large content

## Implementation Plan

The implementation extracts the height and font size adjustment logic to a separate hook file. This manages the dynamic adjustment of textarea heights based on content length and synchronizes both textareas to have the same height. The font size is reduced to 16px when the character count exceeds 450.
